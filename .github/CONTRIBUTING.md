If you spot something strange (something doesn't work or doesn't behave as expected), please open a [bug issue](https://github.com/lucaferranti/GeometricTheoremProver.jl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5Bbug%5D).

If have an improvement idea (a new feature, a new piece of documentation, an enhancement of an existing feature), you can open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/lucaferranti/GeometricTheoremProver.jl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5Benhancement%5D%3A+).

If you feel like your issue does not fit any of the above mentioned templates (e.g. you just want to ask something), you can also open a [blank issue](https://github.com/lucaferranti/GeometricTheoremProver.jl/issues/new).

Pull requests are also very welcome! For small fixes, feel free to open a PR directly. For bigger changes, it might be wise to open an issue first. Also, make sure to checkout the [contributing guidelines](https://juliaintervals.github.io/GeometricTheoremProver.jl/dev/CONTRIBUTING/).
